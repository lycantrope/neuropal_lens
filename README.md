NeuroPAL Lens is a Rust-based application designed to facilitate the visualization and analysis of neurons in *Caenorhabditis elegans* labeled using the NeuroPAL system. This app enables users to check neuron colors (Ref: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.012) and positions (Ref: 10.1186/s12859-022-04738-3).

## Features

- **NeuronPAL Color:** Inspect neuron color labeling using the NeuroPAL system.
- **Neuron Position:** Verify neuron positions within the organism.
- **Web-Based Interface:** Access a lightweight, interactive web app.
